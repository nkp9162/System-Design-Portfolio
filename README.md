# 🎯 System Design Portfolio

> A curated **system design portfolio** covering **Low-Level Design (LLD)**, **High-Level Design (HLD)**, and **real-world project implementations**.  
This repository focuses on **design thinking**, **SOLID principles**, **design patterns**, and **scalable architecture decisions**.
The goal of this repo is to demonstrate *how and why* design decisions are made in real systems.

## 🔥 What's Inside

### 📐 Low-Level Design (LLD)
**Status:** ✅ Active 

### Design Patterns (GoF)

This section covers **all 23 Gang of Four design patterns**, each documented with:
- Problem statement (why the pattern is needed)
- Implementation (with and without the pattern)
- UML / class diagrams
- Trade-offs and limitations
- When *not* to use the pattern

**Categories covered:**

- **Creational (5)**  
  Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory, Builder, Prototype

- **Structural (7)**  
  Adapter, Decorator, Proxy, Facade, Composite, Bridge, Flyweight

- **Behavioral (11)**  
  Strategy, Observer, Command, State, Chain of Responsibility, Iterator,  
  Template Method, Mediator, Memento, Visitor, Interpreter

[➡️ Explore Design Patterns](LLD/design-patterns/)

### LLD Case Studies (Real-World Problems)

A collection of commonly asked **LLD interview problems**, each solved with:
- Clear requirements (functional & non-functional)
- Entity modeling
- Applied design patterns & SOLID principles
- Class & sequence diagrams
- Design trade-offs and future improvements

**Problems included:**

1. Parking Lot System  
2. Library Management System  
3. Elevator System  
4. Hotel Management System  
5. Splitwise (Expense Sharing)  
6. Snake and Ladder Game  
7. Tic-Tac-Toe  
8. Chess Game  
9. ATM System  
10. Movie Ticket Booking System  
11. Online Shopping Cart  
12. LRU Cache Implementation

### 🌐 High-Level Design (HLD)
**Status:** 🚧 Coming Soon

This section will focus on **scalable system design**, including:
- Traffic estimation & capacity planning
- API design
- Database selection & data modeling
- Caching strategies
- Bottlenecks and failure handling
- Trade-off analysis

**Planned systems:**
- URL Shortener
- Twitter / X
- Netflix
- WhatsApp
- Uber

➡️ **Explore:** `HLD/`

### 💼 Real-World Projects
**Status:** 🚧 Coming Soon

End-to-end projects demonstrating:
- Practical use of design patterns
- Layered architecture
- Clean, maintainable code
- Design documentation alongside implementation
- Performance and scalability considerations

➡️ **Location:** `Projects/`

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Design & Diagrams:** Draw.io, PlantUML
- **Documentation:** Markdown
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

---

## Skills Demonstrated

- SOLID Principles
- Object-Oriented Design
- Design Patterns (GoF)
- Low-Level & High-Level System Design
- UML (Class & Sequence Diagrams)
- Clean Code & Maintainable Architecture
- Trade-off & scalability thinking

## 📖 How to Navigate

Each design or project typically contains:
- `README.md` → High-level overview
- `DESIGN.md` → Detailed design decisions & trade-offs
- `diagrams/` → UML and architecture diagrams
- `src/` → Clean, runnable code

---

## 🚀 Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nkp9162/System-Design-Portfolio.git

# Navigate to a specific LLD problem
cd system-design-portfolio/LLD/lld-practice/01-parking-lot-system

# Run the example
python src/main.py
```
